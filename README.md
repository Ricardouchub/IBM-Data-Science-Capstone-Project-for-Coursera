# IBM Data Science Capstone Project: Predicting SpaceX Launch Success


## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository contains the final project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera. In this capstone, I took on the role of a data scientist for a new rocket company, "Space Y," aiming to compete with SpaceX. The primary goal of this project is to analyze SpaceX launch data to determine a competitive launch price and to predict whether the first stage of the rocket will be reused.

To achieve this, I gathered public information about SpaceX launches, created interactive dashboards for the team, and built a machine learning model to predict the successful landing of the first stage. This data-driven approach allows Space Y to make informed decisions in a competitive market.

### Key Questions Addressed:
* What is a competitive launch price for a new rocket company?
* Can we predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage of their rockets?
